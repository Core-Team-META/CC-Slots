The folders under costumeTrigger are at the same position/rotation as the sockets in the player skeleton. 
Pressing F while standing in the costumeTrigger will put the costume on the player.

How to use:
1) create costume out of basic shapes
2) move shapes under the coresponding folders under costumeTrigger/attach_costume_script
   (delete the sample costume folders from under those same nodes)
